		<h1>~~~She blooms for others~~~~</h1>
			<p>my rose isn't really dead</p>
			<p>she is still really beatiful</p>
			<p>and she blooms everyday</p>
			<p>but she blooms for others</p>
			<p>they don't see her like i do</p>
			<p>it doesn't seem to hurt her</p>
			<p>she doesn't know the pain i have</p>
			<p>why doesn't she care</p>
			<p>does she care</p>
			<p>but my rose is still dead</p>
