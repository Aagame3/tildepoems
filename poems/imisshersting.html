		<h1>~~~I miss her sting~~~~</h1>
			<p>my rose used to sting me</p>
			<p>i always hated it</p>
			<p>but i didn't complain</p>
			<p>i tought that nothing is perfect</p>
			<p>everything has its faults</p>
			<p>but it wasn't a fault</p>
			<p>it was a reason to love her more</p>
			<p>i loved every part of her</p>
			<p>i loved her stings</p>
			<p>i didn't realise it then</p>
			<p>i realise it now</p>
			<p>but it's now too late</p>
			<p>i miss the sting</p>
			<p>i miss her</p>
			<p>but my rose is still dead</p>
