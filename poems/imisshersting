my rose used to sting me
i always hated it
but i didn't complain
i tought that nothing is perfect
everything has its faults
but it wasn't a fault
it was a reason to love her more
i loved every part of her
i loved her stings
i didn't realise it then
i realise it now
but it's now too late
i miss the sting
i miss her
but my rose is still dead
