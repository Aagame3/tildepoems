i have a rose
the rose is most beatiful thing i have ever seen
my rose always blooms
even when i'm not near
but sometimes my rose starts dying
it wont show it
i feel it
i dont have the courage to water it
if i overwater it i'll die faster
if i don't water it enough it'll die
i dont know if it's in my head
i dont know if my feelings are real
and that is slowly killing me
